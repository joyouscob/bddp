      </div>

      <div>
         <h2>What is Bridging the Digital Divide Computer Refurbishment?</h2>
         <p>Under the direction of invaluable community volunteer, Jack Rappaport, Binghamton University students refurbish used computers, which are then loaned out to community members through partner organizations. To ensure that recipients are able to use the computers effectively, computers are only loaned to those who have completed a BDDP computer literacy class with a partner organization. </p>
      </div>

      <div>
         <h2>Time Commitment</h2>
         <p>Computer refurbishment sessions are usually held once per week, typically on the weekends (2-3 hours per session), for the duration of the semester. Volunteers are expected to attend every session and to notify the Refurbishment Director if they will not be able to attend.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
         <h2>Characteristics of a Qualified Refurbishment Volunteer:</h2>
         <p>Student volunteers are drawn from all academic pursuits. The key criteria are that each student:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Has an interest in learning about the computer refurbishment process</li>
            <li>Is able to follow directions well</li>
            <li>Is reliable, willing and able to devote two to three hours on Saturday mornings or afternoons during the semester</li>
         </ul>
      </div>   

      <div> 
         <h2>Refurbishment Volunteer Activities:</h2>
         <h3>Refurbishment consists of a number of steps:</h3>

         <ul>
            <li>Thorough cleaning of the computer to remove accumulated dust and debris which can affect airflow (cooling) of electronics.</li>
            <li>Examination of equipment to establish the how much memory and hard drive capacity it has, and if less than minimum standards are present, it is upgraded to acceptable limits.</li>
            <li>Testing of key components to ensure performance and hard drives are rigorously wiped to remove traces of previous owner activity.</li>
            <li>Installation of new software consisting of a Windows Operating System, office, and other commonly used applications, utilities, and an antivirus program.</li>
            <li>Finally, the units are "cleaned up" by assuring that all updates are done. This includes:</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Running software, cleaning utilities, defragmenting the hard drive, performing a complete antivirus scan, and executing an audit program which logs all system information for retention by the BDDP staff in case problems or questions arise at any time.</li>
            </ul>
         </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
         <h2>Next Steps: Get Involved!</h2>

         <p>Please email Erin Small, BDDP Refurbishment Volunteer Coordinator at esmall2@binghamton.edu to indicate your interest in becoming a computer refurbishment volunteer. As with the computer literacy program, it is best to indicate interest at the start of the semester. Once refurbishment sessions are underway, BDDP does not usually accept more refurbishment volunteers.</p>
